bing9954/1.py LB: 0.9954 #97
bing9954/2.py sdict['lbs'] = 'pounds' sdict['mi²'] = 'square miles' sdict['m³'] = 'cubic meters' LB: 0.9954 unchanged
bing9954/3.py more sdicts, same result on LB: 0.9954
bing9954/4.py added more num2words handling cases, same on LB 0.9954
 ==> manually edited e.g. awk -F, '{print $2}' !$ | grep 1  still the same LB: 0.9954
bing9954/5.py add back in train and look for errors...
bing9954/6.py took 4 and fixed four training examples... same LB:
7.py same as 5, but look at errors using the big google data e.g. ../input/en_with_types/output-00000-of-00100 

NEED to use context to do DATE vs CARDINAL, but how can we get the context?? Can we use bing99637 ???
1) Review all kinds of errors and paste here
Found Errors on input: 200 , modified to: two hundred ,golden: two o o ,class: DIGIT
Found Errors on input: 1917 , modified to: nineteen seventeen ,golden: one thousand nine hundred seventeen ,class: CARDINAL
...
2) Review bing99637 to see if we can get the class
3) modify into the main script.






TODO:
DARN, no change for line: 2016-04-04, should be like  March seventeen one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight
